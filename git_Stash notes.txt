git stash
that will remove the modified code from working directory

222222222222
git stash apply
this will laod back those changes into the working directory that was removed when we did "git stash"

git stash list
it will list out all those stash that we had done(same like what git commit --oneline does)

git stash push -m"stashing message"
impppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
when we do that and after that when we do git stash list then in that list we will get last one with specific message(same like commit message)

dropping stash from (git stash list)
git stash drop 3(basically version no that you want to drop)

how tor remove any specific stash from out list without dropping nad even directly applying to our code
git stash pop 1(git stash list specific version that you want o remove from list and apply to our working directory)

Clearing all stash from list once our work is done
git stash clear
(git stash list ===== will give 0 from list because we just cleared everyhting)
